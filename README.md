# Smart Greenhouse System ðŸŒ±  

The **Smart Greenhouse System** is a project under development. It aims to automate greenhouse management to optimize plant growth, conserve resources, and promote sustainable farming practices. The system integrates sensors and controllers to maintain ideal growing conditions with minimal manual intervention.

## Current Progress  
- Initial project planning and design completed.  
- Hardware components selected (e.g., sensors, ESP32 chip).  
- Basic framework setup for data collection.  
- Preliminary coding started using C language for sensor integration and control logic.  

## Planned Features  
- Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity.  
- Automated climate control for optimal plant growth.  
- Smart irrigation and fertigation to reduce water and fertilizer waste.  
- Renewable energy integration using solar panels.  
- User interface design for easy system control and monitoring.

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Languages**: C  
- **Hardware**: ESP32 chip, sensors (e.g., DHT11, soil moisture sensors), solar panels.  
- **Power Source**: Solar energy.

## Installation (Future Steps)  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-greenhouse-system.git  
   ```  
2. Set up the hardware and connect sensors to the ESP32 chip.  
3. Upload the C code to the ESP32 using a suitable IDE (e.g., Arduino IDE).  
4. Power up the system and start monitoring and controlling the environment.

## How It Works (Planned)  
1. Sensors will collect environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity).  
2. Data will be processed by the ESP32 chip to determine necessary adjustments.  
3. Controllers will manage irrigation, ventilation, and lighting based on system decisions.  
4. Solar panels will provide the necessary power for the system.

## Future Enhancements  
- Adding support for diverse plant types.  
- Expanding renewable energy sources for powering the system.
